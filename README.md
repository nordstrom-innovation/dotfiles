# Innovation Lab Pairing Station Dot Files

These are the configuration files I want to have on every pairing station I use.

Original files copied from [westcave](https://github.com/westcave/dotfiles).
They were then adapted for use with OS X and Linux-specific configuration was
removed.

## Installation

    git clone git://github.com/nordstrom-innovation/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ~/.dotfiles/install

## Contents

Most files handle Bash and text editor configuration (Vim, and TextMate 2, so far),
as well as additional files for configuring utilities such as iTerm2,
GNU Screen, Git, ack and rvm.

### Configuration file generators

There are some configuration files, such as _.gitconfig_ that might contain
sensitive data or that have contents that vary across different machines. For
these cases, a generator is used. 

These generators are simple bash scripts containing a template for the
file they generate. The values for variable fields are requested during
execution or they can be provided with environment variables for unattended
installation.

### Bash configuration

bash configuration files live in the _.bash.d_ directory.

_.bashrc_. sources configuration files in this order:

 * Every file under _.bash.d/local/before_
 * Every file under _.bash.d_
 * Every file under _.bash.d/local/after_

Contents of _.bash.d/local_ are not tracked by git, so this is the place to
add configuration files that are specific for the current machine.

### Vim configuration

Using [Gmarik's Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) Vim plug-in to
manage Vim add-ons and keep them up to date.

Vundle clones each add-on under its own directory and adds it to
Vim's runtime path.

All add-ons in the official Vim's website are actively mirrored in github by
the [Vim-Scripts.org](http://vim-scripts.org/) project. This means Vundle can
be used to install any add-on published in the official site.

Use command :BundleInstall! inside vim to update all plug-ins. 

### Utility Bash scripts
Put them in bin
